- 👋 Hi, I’m @franciscojavierpanosmadrona
- 🤦‍♂ A little about me and my work, I have a specialty, which is development with PHP especially with the Laravel framework, my favorite, although I have also had to use other fameworks such as Synfony, CakePHP or Codeigniter, after so many years programming I consider myself more A back-end programmer, although I know that I am more than capable of front-end development, my versatility always opts for the back-end.
- 🤷‍♂️ I have worked with many other languages, to give some examples:
    - SQL (Databases)
    - Native Javascript, "jQuery Library, Vue Framework, ..." (Web)
    - Java (Android, Desktop Applications)
    - C (Arduino, IoT)
    - C++, C# (Unreal Engine, Unity)
    - Python (AI)
- 👀 I am interested in the development of really useful utilities and applications that save the valuable time of people and companies, although I do not do it selflessly, if it is true that I like the idea of helping, by contributing that saving of time to the person who use the applications I build, automating them if possible, because we all have a limited time to live and we want to make the most of it trying to be as happy as we can in the process.
- 🎶 I love music, all of it, although obviously some much more than others, but I listen to everything, to work the vast majority is relaxing music to concentrate better. ^_^`
- 🌱 Currently I'm learning, and I'll always be learning, it is what has this profession.
- 📫 coming soon ...
